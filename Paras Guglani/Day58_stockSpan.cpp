/**
 *  Stock Span
 *  -   Afzal has been working with an organization called 'Money Traders'
 *      for the past few years. The organization is into the money trading
 *      business. His manager assigned him a task. For a given array/list
 *      of stock's prices for N days, find the stock's span for each day.
 *  -   The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number
 *      of consecutive days(starting from today and going backwards) for which
 *      the price of the stock was less than today's price.
 *  -   For example, if the price of a stock over a period of 7 days are
 *      [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85], then the stock spans will be
 *      [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6].
 *
 *  Input Format:
 *      The first line of input contains an integer N, denoting the total number of days.
 *      The second line of input contains the stock prices of each day. A single space
 *      will separate them.
 *  Output Format:
 *      The only line of output will print the span for each day's stock price. A
 *      single space will separate them.
 *
 *  Constraints:
 *      0 <= N <= 10^7
 *      1 <= X <= 10^9
 *      Where X denotes the stock's price for a day.
 *
 *  Time Limit: 1 second
 *
 *  Sample Input 1:
 *      4
 *      10 10 10 10
 *  Sample Output 1:
 *      1 1 1 1
 *
 *  Sample Input 2:
 *      8
 *      60 70 80 100 90 75 80 120
 *  Sample Output 2:
 *      1 2 3 4 1 1 2 8
